# Valorant Quick True Stretch

## Description
"Valorant True Stretched" has some function to simplify for modifying Valorant app window, as you know that not all user understand using Winexp, so this script will help you to do.

## Features
- Disabling WS_DLGFRAME and WS_BORDER
- Maximizes the Valorant application window

## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the script.
4. Run the script using Python: `python trueStretched.py`.
5. The script will apply the desired effect to the Valorant window.

Alternatively, you can download a ready-to-use executable file from the Release section. Simply download the latest release and run the executable on your system.
1. Open your Valorant game
2. set display option on windowed and fill (no need to change your resolution in game)
3. after that go to desktop and change your system resolution on windows settings (find your own resolution on google with your preferred aspect ratio, example : "4:3 aspect ratio resolution")
4. apply your system resolution and run the executable file and your valorant will become windowed fullscreen and stretched

note : if u want to keep the stretch option, just change your system display to your previous resolution before open the game, so you don't need to run the script again.
